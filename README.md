iOS 10 has just been released and with it, Swift 3. Swift is a new programming language from Apple, designed specifically for creating iOS, OS X and watchOS apps.

Even though it's only a couple years old, Swift is already very popular with iOS developers.

In this course you will learn how to use Swift 3 to create iOS apps. Whether you're new to iOS app development, or are looking to make the switch from Objective-C, this course will get you started with Swift for app development. You'll learn about all the basic features of the language from varaibles to classes.
